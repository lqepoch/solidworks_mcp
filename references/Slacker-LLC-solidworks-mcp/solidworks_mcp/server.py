"""A local, stdio-only MCP bridge for a running SOLIDWORKS instance.

The bridge does not launch SOLIDWORKS, execute arbitrary code, access the
network, or register an add-in.  It attaches to a session the user already has
open and drives it through the documented COM API.

Unit contract: every length is millimetres and every angle is degrees at the
MCP boundary, which is why the parameters are named ``*_mm`` and ``*_deg``.
The COM API underneath is metres and radians; conversion happens once, in
sw_core.

Layout
------
sw_core      COM attachment, units, feature tree, topology, selection engine
sw_file      session status, documents, saving, exporting, appearance, material
sw_refgeom   reference planes and axes
sw_sketch    sketches, sketch geometry, relations, dimensions
sw_feature   solid features
sw_inspect   topology listings, measurement, mass properties, screenshots
sw_assembly  components and mates
sw_drawing   drawing sheets, views, and annotation
sw_demo      the basketball demo, registered only when SW_MCP_DEMO_TOOLS is set
