# solidworks-mcp

An MCP server that drives a **running** SOLIDWORKS session over its COM API.

It does not launch SOLIDWORKS, register an add-in, execute arbitrary code, or
touch the network. It attaches to a session you already have open and calls the
documented API — so if a tool can't do something, neither could a macro.

92 tools: sketching with real relations and driving dimensions, the solid
features you actually reach for, reference geometry, assemblies and mates, and —
importantly — a feedback channel, including screenshots returned as images so
the model can see what it just built.

A sibling server, [`autocad-mcp`](https://github.com/limuzi013/autocad-mcp),
does the same for AutoCAD.

## Requirements

- Windows, with SOLIDWORKS installed and **already running**
- Python 3.10+

## Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/limuzi013/solidworks-mcp.git
cd solidworks-mcp
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install .
```

That puts a `solidworks-mcp` command in the environment, which is what the MCP
host runs. `uv` works too, if you prefer it:

```powershell
uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/limuzi013/solidworks-mcp solidworks-mcp
```

### Claude Code / Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "solidworks-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\.venv\\Scripts\\solidworks-mcp.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex CLI (`~/.codex/config.toml`)

```toml
[mcp_servers.solidworks-mcp]
command = 'C:\path\to\.venv\Scripts\solidworks-mcp.exe'
```

Use single-quoted TOML strings so backslashes survive. Restart the MCP host after
editing its configuration.

An MCP host can also be pointed straight at a checkout, with nothing installed
but the dependencies — `server.py` at the repository root exists for exactly
that:

```toml
[mcp_servers.solidworks-mcp]
command = 'C:\path\to\.venv\Scripts\python.exe'
args = ['C:\path\to\solidworks-mcp\server.py']
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SW_MCP_OUTPUT_ROOT` | `~/Documents/solidworks-mcp` | Every file the server writes stays under here. Paths outside it are refused. |
| `SW_MCP_TEMPLATE_DIR` | auto-discovered | Where to look for `.prtdot` / `.asmdot` / `.drwdot` templates if SOLIDWORKS has no default configured. |
| `SW_MCP_DEMO_TOOLS` | unset | Set to `1` to register the basketball demo tools. Off by default: a `create_basketball` sitting next to `revolve` measurably degrades tool selection. |

---

## The two ideas that make it usable

### 1. Units are explicit, always

Every length parameter ends in `_mm` and every angle in `_deg`. The COM API
underneath is metres and radians; conversion happens once, at the boundary. No
tool has ever silently taken metres.

### 2. Selection is declarative

SOLIDWORKS features read from an implicit global selection set, with per-feature
"marks" deciding which selection means what. Exposing that to an agent is
hopeless. Instead every tool that needs geometry takes the same `selection`
object, and the server sets the marks:

```jsonc
// list_edges first, then:
{ "selection": { "edges": [4, 6, 9] } }
{ "selection": { "face_edges": [2] } }        // every edge of face 2
{ "selection": { "planes": ["front"] } }
{ "selection": { "sketch_segments": [0, 1] } }
{ "selection": { "points": [{ "x_mm": 30, "y_mm": 0, "z_mm": 20, "type": "FACE" }] } }
```

Indices come from `list_faces` / `list_edges` / `list_vertices` /
`list_sketch_segments` and describe the **current** model state — re-list after
any geometry change. Under the hood, selection resolves to a point that provably
lies on the entity and picks by 3D coordinate, which survives the fact that
late-bound Python cannot QueryInterface a `Face2` to `IEntity`.

## Tools

### Session and documents
| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `solidworks_status` | Verify the connection; report version and active document. |
| `get_active_document_info` | Title, path, type, unsaved state. |
| `create_new_document` | New part / assembly / drawing from the default template. |
| `open_document` | Open a `.sldprt` / `.sldasm` / `.slddrw`. |
| `save_document` / `save_active_document` | Save-as under the output root / save in place. |
| `export_document` | STEP, IGES, STL, Parasolid, 3MF, or an image. |
| `rebuild_document` | Rebuild and report failing features. |
| `set_appearance` / `set_material` | Display colour; real material (so mass properties mean something). |

### Reference geometry
`list_reference_planes`, `create_plane` (offset / angle / midplane / three points /
parallel-through-point), `create_axis`.

### Sketching
`create_sketch` (on a plane **or a model face**), `edit_sketch`, `close_sketch`,
`list_sketches`, `list_sketch_segments`, `get_sketch_status`.

Geometry: `draw_line`, `draw_centerline`, `draw_circle`, `draw_rectangle`,
`draw_arc`, `draw_3point_arc`, `draw_ellipse`, `draw_polygon`, `draw_slot`,
`draw_point`, `draw_spline`.

Editing: `sketch_fillet`, `sketch_chamfer`, `sketch_trim`, `sketch_offset`,
`sketch_mirror`, `convert_entities`, `set_construction_geometry`.

Parametrics: `add_relation`, `add_dimension`, `set_dimension`, `list_dimensions`.

### Features
`boss_extrude`, `cut_extrude`, `revolve`, `fillet`, `chamfer`, `shell`, `draft`,
`rib`, `simple_hole`, `sweep`, `loft`, `linear_pattern`, `circular_pattern`,
`mirror_feature`, `delete_feature`, `rename_feature`, `set_feature_suppression`.

### Inspection — the feedback channel
| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `capture_screenshot` | Returns the view as an **image**, so the model can look at its own work. |
| `list_faces` / `list_edges` / `list_vertices` / `list_bodies` | Topology with types, sizes, and selection indices. Filterable by surface type, area, normal direction, curve type, length. |
| `get_mass_properties` / `get_bounding_box` / `measure` | Numbers to check the geometry against. |
| `check_errors` | What SOLIDWORKS thinks is wrong — see below. |
| `set_view` | Named view plus zoom-to-fit. |

### Assemblies
`list_components`, `insert_component`, `add_mate`, `list_mates`,
`set_component_fixed`.

### Engineering drawings
`create_drawing`, `list_sheets`, `add_sheet`, `activate_sheet`,
`insert_standard_views`, `insert_model_view`, `insert_projected_view`,
`insert_section_view`, `insert_detail_view`, `list_drawing_views`,
`activate_drawing_view`, `create_drawing_sketch`, `set_drawing_view`,
`insert_model_annotations`, `auto_dimension_view`, `insert_center_marks`,
`insert_centerlines`, `add_note`.

For section and detail views, call `create_drawing_sketch` after activating the
parent view, then use the normal `draw_line` or `draw_circle` sketch tools.

## A worked example

```jsonc
create_new_document   { "kind": "part" }
create_sketch         { "plane": "front", "name": "Base" }

add_dimension         { "selection": { "sketch_segments": [0] }, "kind": "horizontal",
                        "value_mm": 80, "place_x_mm": 40, "place_y_mm": -10 }
add_dimension         { "selection": { "sketch_segments": [1] }, "kind": "vertical",
                        "value_mm": 50, "place_x_mm": -10, "place_y_mm": 30 }
close_sketch          {}
boss_extrude          { "depth_mm": 20, "name": "BasePad" }

list_edges            { "curve_type": "line", "min_length_mm": 19 }   // find the four verticals
fillet                { "radius_mm": 5, "selection": { "edges": [0, 1, 2, 3] } }
shell                 { "thickness_mm": 2, "selection": { "faces": [4] } }

capture_screenshot    { "view": "isometric" }
get_mass_properties   {}
```

## Notes from the implementation

These are the things that cost real time. They are documented because anyone
automating SOLIDWORKS from Python will hit them.

**SOLIDWORKS members are inconsistently exposed to pywin32.** Most are declared
in the type library as `PROPGET` *with arguments*. Late-bound pywin32 may resolve
such a member on plain attribute access by invoking it with **no** arguments.
`IBody2.GetFaces` then returns a bound method that looks like a one-element
result — which is why an extruded box reported exactly one face. Worse,
`ModelDocExtension.AddDimension` invoked that way **crashes SOLIDWORKS outright**.
`sw_core.flag_methods()` calls `_FlagAsMethod` on every member the server invokes
with arguments, and `sw_core.value()` invokes zero-argument callables rather than
returning the method object.

**Modal dialogs deadlock the server.** `AddDimension2` pops the "Modify" box
whenever *Input dimension value* is enabled — which is the default. A modal
dialog blocks the COM call that opened it, and with it the whole server, until
somebody clicks. Dimension tools turn the preference off and restore it after.
If a tool ever hangs, look for a dialog behind the SOLIDWORKS window.

**Return values lie.** `SketchTrim` returns `False` on success. The `Create*`
sketch APIs return arrays whose truthiness is unreliable. `SketchAddConstraints`
takes a magic string and *silently ignores* one it does not recognise. So the
drawing tools judge success by the sketch's segment count, `sketch_trim` by
whether the sketch actually changed, and `add_relation` uses the typed
`ISketchRelationManager.AddRelation` and verifies via the relation count — and on
failure reports which relations that selection *would* accept.

**Most failures are silent.** SOLIDWORKS returns null far more often than it
raises. Every feature tool therefore rebuilds and reports
`ModelDocExtension.GetWhatsWrong`, and `check_errors` exposes it directly.

**`sketch_trim` needs its target selected.** Pass the segment in `selection`;
the point alone only tells SOLIDWORKS which piece to discard.

**Multi-reference features want distinct marks.** `InsertRefPlane` reads its
first, second, and third reference from *marks 0, 1, 2* — not from selection
order. Selecting all of them with mark 0 silently produces nothing, which is why
`create_plane` selects each reference with its own mark and documents that
references are consumed in written order.

**Two unit traps.** `IPartDoc.GetPartBox(False)` returns *document* units, not
metres, so it reads 1000x large if you treat it like the rest of the API; pass
`True`. And `swSketchLINE` is `0`, so folding a segment type through `or` turns
every line into "unknown".

## Known limitations

- One SOLIDWORKS session, one COM apartment: tool calls are serialised. Two
  clients driving the same session at once will deadlock it.
- Snapshot indices from `list_faces` / `list_edges` are invalidated by any
  geometry change. Re-list; do not cache.
- A modal dialog opened by SOLIDWORKS for any *other* reason will still block
  the server until dismissed.
- `rib` is picky about its profile. `InsertRib` returns void and simply builds
  nothing unless the open profile reaches material at both ends *and* the
  extrusion direction can get there. The tool defaults to `parallel_to_sketch`
  (right for a cross-section profile) and retries the other direction
  automatically, reporting which one worked. A profile that overlaps an existing
  rib still fails, and the tool says so rather than pretending.
- Only the **first** `insert_projected_view` off a given parent succeeds;
  subsequent projections from the same parent return nothing, through
  re-activation and rebuild alike. Use `insert_standard_views` for a full
  orthographic set.
- Detail-view scale is **absolute** (model to paper), not relative to the parent.
  On a 1:4 sheet, `2:1` makes the detail eight times the parent view and it
  overflows the sheet. Pick a scale near the sheet scale.
- Standard-plane and model-view display names are localized. Use `front`,
  `top`, and `right` for reference planes, and use names returned by
  `list_drawing_views` for drawing views; do not hard-code English UI labels.
- `through_all_both` is translated internally to a two-direction feature with
  `through_all` in both directions. Passing `swEndCondThroughAllBoth` as a
  single-ended feature silently cuts only one side in SOLIDWORKS 2026.
- `circular_pattern` cannot pattern a feature that built a *separate* body
  (`merge: false`) — SOLIDWORKS rejects the feature scope. Merge the body, or
  pattern the body instead.
- `save_document` cannot overwrite a file SOLIDWORKS currently has open, even
  with `overwrite: true`. The error says so when that is the cause.

## Testing

The useful tests are live SOLIDWORKS tests: the COM behaviour that matters here
cannot be mocked faithfully. With SOLIDWORKS already running, run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tests\live_p0_regression.py
```

It verifies the P0 geometry/constraint regressions, including the full-volume
`through_all_both` cut.

Every tool has been exercised against SOLIDWORKS 2026 SP3.2 on a Simplified
Chinese install. Where a result could be checked numerically it was: the revolved
ring, swept rod and lofted cone match their closed-form volumes; a 5-degree
`draft` removes exactly the expected wedge; `rib` produces exactly the triangle
under its profile; `through_all_both` removes the full cylinder rather than half
of it. The limitations above are what survived that pass.

## Layout

| Module | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `sw_core.py` | COM attachment, units, feature tree, topology enumeration, selection engine, tool registry |
| `sw_file.py` | Session status, documents, saving, exporting, appearance, material |
| `sw_refgeom.py` | Reference planes and axes |
| `sw_sketch.py` | Sketches, geometry, editing, relations, dimensions |
| `sw_feature.py` | Solid features |
| `sw_inspect.py` | Topology listings, measurement, mass properties, screenshots |
| `sw_assembly.py` | Components and mates |
| `sw_drawing.py` | Sheets, views, model items, dimensions, center marks, notes |
| `sw_demo.py` | Basketball demo, opt-in via `SW_MCP_DEMO_TOOLS` |
| `tests/live_p0_regression.py` | Live regression checks for the confirmed P0 part/sketch defects |
| `tools/tlb_probe.py` | Reads signatures and enums straight off your installed type library |
| `server.py` | Registry assembly and stdio dispatch |

`tools/tlb_probe.py` is worth knowing about before you add a tool. The published
API reference disagrees with the shipped type library often enough to matter —
`FeatureFillet3` takes 14 arguments here, not the documented 7 — so check first:

```bash
python tools/tlb_probe.py methods '^IFeatureManager$' '^FeatureFillet3$'
python tools/tlb_probe.py enums '^swMateType_e$'
```

Adding a tool means writing one decorated function; the registry does the rest.

```python
@tool("my_tool", "What it does. Lengths are millimetres.",
      {"depth_mm": {"type": "number"}}, ["depth_mm"])
def my_tool(args: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    _, doc = require_part()
    ...
    return result(True, "Did the thing.")
```
