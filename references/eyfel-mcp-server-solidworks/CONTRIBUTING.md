# Contributing Guide

Thanks for contributing to SolidPilot. This document summarizes how to set up the development environment, the architectural rules, and the flow for adding a new capability.

SolidPilot is an AI-driven CAD automation system for SolidWorks that runs as an MCP server. For an overview, see [README.md](README.md).

## Architecture and invariants

The system has four layers, and preserving these boundaries is the foundation of the project:

| Layer | Directory | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `cad-planner` | `cad-planner/` | Intent -> CAD-neutral Feature Graph IR. Does not touch COM, does not emit raw tool calls. |
| `compiler/solidworks` | `compiler/solidworks/` | IR -> tool calls + reference resolution. Deterministic; contains no LLM and no MCP. |
| `execution/solidworks` | `execution/solidworks/` | The only layer that touches SolidWorks COM (C#, .NET 4.8). |
| `adapters/claude` | `adapters/claude/` | MCP protocol bridge (Python, MCP SDK v2). |

Rules that must never be violated:

- The AI works at the **feature level**; only the compiler knows tools; only `SolidWorksService.cs` touches COM.
- **MCP is the top boundary** (between the client and the IR), not an internal transport. The compiler reaches the execution layer over plain REST.
- The IR is **CAD-neutral**; SolidWorks-specific details live only in the compiler and execution layers.
- The execution and planner layers have no knowledge of which client is calling them.
- Adding a new CAD backend means adding a new compiler and execution layer; the IR and `cad-planner` stay unchanged.
- The adapter layer is provider-specific. Supporting a new AI client (OpenClaw, OpenAI, a local LLM, etc.) means only adding a new adapter that reuses the shared bridge core.

## Development environment

### Requirements
- Windows and **SolidWorks 2026** (development happens against a local SolidWorks install).
- **.NET Framework 4.8** and MSBuild (ships with Visual Studio 2022).
- **Python 3.x** and the official **MCP Python SDK v2** (`mcp>=2.0.0`) for the MCP adapter.

### Building and running the execution layer

Build:

```
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" execution\solidworks\SolidworksExecution.sln /t:Build /p:Configuration=Debug
```

Restart (headless, `http://localhost:5000`):

```
Get-Process SolidworksExecution -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
Start-Process execution\solidworks\SolidworksExecution\bin\Debug\SolidworksExecution.exe -WindowStyle Hidden
```

The server runs headless and must be running while SolidWorks is open (the COM connection is established lazily, on the first tool call). C#-side errors and per-request traces are written to `execution\solidworks\SolidworksExecution\bin\Debug\execution.log`.

### Running the adapter

```
cd adapters/claude
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

**Important:** the Python MCP adapter does not hot-reload while running. When you change `server.py` (for example, adding a new parameter), the MCP server must be reconnected. Reconnecting also resets the adapter's local `state_version` to 0. (The C# execution server, by contrast, can be restarted.)

## Adding a new capability

### A new low-level tool (execution surface)

1. **Contract** — add the tool to `execution/solidworks/contracts/tool-schemas.json`.
2. **Execution** — add a `case "tool_name":` in `ToolController.cs` and implement it in the matching `SolidWorksService.<Family>.cs` **partial class** under `Services/` (one class split by tool family: core / Sketch / Features / SheetMetal / Drawing / Analyze / Assembly; a new file also needs a `<Compile Include>` entry in the csproj). **Verify any SolidWorks COM API signature by reflecting the interop assembly first — never invent a method name or argument list.** The real API frequently differs from what looks plausible (for example, the model-item insertion API lives on `IDrawingDoc`, not `IView`; `GetLines3` returns empty while `GetPolylines7` is the working geometry getter). Decode unknown return shapes empirically against a live document before writing the parser.
3. **Adapter** — register the MCP tool in `adapters/claude/server.py`. Model-facing guidance lives here (the client never sees `tool-schemas.json`): use `Literal` enums for discriminators, Pydantic `Field` constraints for units and ranges, and real required parameters.
4. **Verify** — run the contract test (see below), then validate against live SolidWorks.

### A new feature (IR level — the strategic direction)

1. Add the feature type to `cad-planner/contracts/feature-graph.schema.json` (this also registers the capability).
2. Add its lowering rule and any required reference resolution in `compiler/solidworks`.
3. It reuses existing low-level tools; usually no new execution tool is needed.

> **The two IR doors:** `rebuild_from_ir` is the **reverse** door (rebuilds a part/assembly from its analysis artifact's IR block — the round-trip that verifies an LLM-proposed IR). `submit_feature_graph` is the **forward** door (builds from a Feature Graph the model supplies directly, from design intent, with no original to copy); it is **live and gate-free**. Both doors run through the same `pycompiler` — **never fork the compiler**. Note the different failure surface: the reverse door can warn `source_stale` because it has an artifact hash to check, whereas the forward door takes a raw graph and has nothing to compare against — so a forward run must self-verify by computing its expected outcome (see the `recipe://usage/forward` resource).

## Conventions

- **Units:** all lengths are in meters (SolidWorks internal units). Angles are taken in degrees at the adapter boundary.
- **HTTP semantics:** all CAD results return HTTP 200; `FAILED` and `DUPLICATE` are domain states, not transport errors. HTTP 400 is only for malformed requests or unknown tool names.
- **state_version:** every request is checked with strict equality; a mismatch returns `FAILED` with `INVALID_STATE_VERSION`. The adapter increments its local value only on a `COMPLETED` response.
- **Variable-length array parameters** must be passed as a JSON string at the MCP boundary (e.g. `points: str = "[]"`), not as a `list`/`List` type. The MCP client stringifies list-typed arguments, which makes a list-typed parameter uncallable; parse the string in the adapter (`json.loads`) or in C#.
- **C# JSON:** parameters are deserialized as a `JObject`; use `p.Value<T>("key")`. Serialization is camelCase and null values are omitted.
- **swconst enums:** must be used as inlined constants, never as runtime types (the relevant DLL is not copied into `bin/Debug`; using one as a type causes a runtime load failure).

---

## Testing

- **Contract test:** catches any tool or parameter drift between `server.py` and `tool-schemas.json`, **and guards the MCP resource surface**: every `recipe://` / `schema://` URI mentioned anywhere in `server.py` must resolve to a registered resource or template, every served recipe section must exist in `recipe-usage.md`, and a section present in the file but NOT served fails too (so the surface cannot grow by accident either). That second half matters because the recipe is reached by URI now — a renamed URI whose docstring pointer was not updated would otherwise fail *silently*, with the model simply never finding the rules.

  ```
  cd adapters/claude
  python tests/test_schema_contract.py
  ```

  or run it via `pytest`.

- **Live testing (manual by design):** tools are verified against live SolidWorks, with the GUI open, case by case. A cohesive batch of tools is chosen together and tested as a batch. When a tool fails, inspect `execution.log` and report the expected result, the API response, and a hypothesis. For drawing tools, the exported **PDF is the ground truth** — some interop counters under-report (e.g. inserted annotations / center marks), so confirm a drawing change by exporting and reading the PDF rather than trusting an in-band count alone.

- **Compiler suite:** `compiler/solidworks/pycompiler/tests/` exercises IR validation, lowering, and reference resolution against a fake execution port — fully offline.

  ```
  cd compiler/solidworks
  python -m pycompiler.tests.test_compiler
  ```

Both offline suites run in **CI on every push/PR** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The C# layer is not built in CI — it requires the licensed SolidWorks interop assemblies; C# behavior is verified live instead.
