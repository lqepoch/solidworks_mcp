"""Single-threaded COM execution for SolidWorks.

COM is single-threaded-apartment (STA) and thread-affine: every call must run on
the same thread that CoInitialized the apartment and connected to SolidWorks.
The MCP server runs on an asyncio event loop, and tool handlers may be scheduled
in ways that make "just call it inline" unsafe over time. So we pin ALL COM work
to one dedicated thread and have handlers submit callables to it.

This is how the kickoff principle "one COM session, single-threaded" is actively
enforced inside an async server -- it does not happen by itself.

The worker blocks on a queue (event-driven, no polling) and runs one job at a
time, which also serialises calls exactly as the stateful SolidWorks API wants.

Design constraints to be aware of:
- Non-pumping STA: the loop only blocks on the queue; it never calls
  PumpWaitingMessages. That is fine for a purely outbound, out-of-process client
  that registers NO COM event sinks (the current usage). Do not register event
  sinks on this thread without adding a message pump.
- No in-flight cancellation: a COM call cannot be force-aborted once started, so
  `call` enforces a timeout on the *await* (surfacing a readable error) but the
  worker thread itself stays on the blocked call until SolidWorks returns.
