"""Verified SolidWorks enum constants.

Source: the installed swconst.tlb (SOLIDWORKS 2026, typelib v34), read directly
via scripts/introspect_api.py. Hardcoded here -- with their enum of origin -- so
the server has no runtime dependency on the makepy constant cache. Note e.g.
swDefaultTemplatePart == 8 on this build (not 9, as often stated online): always
trust the installed library over web docs.
