# SolidWorks MCP

An MCP server that drives a **locally running SolidWorks** instance over the COM
API (pywin32), so an AI agent can build, measure and export parametric parts —
and run a closed **build → measure → verify → correct** loop.

The point isn't just "make geometry". Parametric CAD gives *hard, verifiable
signals* (rebuild status, mass properties, measurements, bounding box), which
makes an agentic correction loop realistic instead of "it looks about right".

> ⚠️ **Early draft (v0.2).** This is still an experimental release. It
> works end-to-end on the author's setup (SOLIDWORKS 2026 / 3DEXPERIENCE R2026x),
> and every feature is verified against a hand calculation — but the tool surface
> and conventions may still change, and it has only been tested against one
> SolidWorks build. Use it as a starting point, not a finished product. Feedback
> and contributions are welcome. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Status (v0.2)

Proven end-to-end against **SOLIDWORKS 2026 (3DEXPERIENCE R2026x)**:

| Milestone | What it proves | State |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | COM connection to a running SolidWorks | ✅ |
| M1 | new part → sketch rectangle → extrude → mass properties (volume matches hand calc) | ✅ |
| M2 | change a named dimension → rebuild → volume changes predictably | ✅ |
| M3 | full agent loop via the MCP server: build → measure → correct → export STEP/STL + screenshot | ✅ |
| M4 | revolve, sweep, loft, profiles, holes/pockets/counterbores, slots, fillet/chamfer, shell, patterns, equations, materials, save/open | 🚧 ongoing |
| M5 | end-to-end 3D-print part: build a functional mounting bracket through the full loop → verify every dimension → export a fine STL ([scripts/m5_demo_bracket.py](scripts/m5_demo_bracket.py)) | ✅ |
| M6 | assemblies: insert and position components, mate them, check interference — a furnished room assembled and proven clash-free ([scripts/m6_demo_kamer.py](scripts/m6_demo_kamer.py)) | ✅ |

See [Docs/PROGRESS.md](Docs/PROGRESS.md) for the detailed log and roadmap.

## Requirements

- Windows, with SolidWorks installed and a valid licence.
- SolidWorks **running** (the server attaches to the active instance; it does not
  launch one).
- Python 3.11+.

## Setup

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .
```

This installs `pywin32` + the `mcp` SDK and the `solidworks-mcp` package
(editable). The first COM call generates the SolidWorks typelib wrappers
automatically (this can take a few seconds the very first time).

## Quickstart

1. **Start SolidWorks** and leave it open (the server attaches to the running
   instance — it does not launch one).
2. Install the package into a venv (see [Setup](#setup)).
3. Sanity-check the connection: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\probe_connection.py`
   should report the SolidWorks revision and active document.
4. Build something end-to-end: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\m5_demo_bracket.py`
   builds a mounting bracket and verifies every step against a hand calculation.
5. To use it as an MCP server from an AI client, see [Use as an MCP server](#use-as-an-mcp-server).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Geen draaiende SolidWorks gevonden" / connection fails** — SolidWorks must be
  *running* before you start the server or run a script; it attaches to the active
  instance via `GetActiveObject` and does not launch one.
- **First call is slow or `EnsureModule` errors** — the first COM call generates the
  makepy typelib wrappers under your temp `gen_py` folder. Let it finish; if it gets
  into a bad state, delete the `gen_py` cache and retry. Early binding is mandatory on
  this build (see [Architecture](#architecture)).
- **A feature returns `{ok: false, error: ...}`** — that is by design: every tool
  fails loud with a readable (Dutch) message rather than silently producing wrong
  geometry. Read the message; it names the likely cause.
- **Only tested against SOLIDWORKS 2026 (3DEXPERIENCE R2026x).** On other builds the
  verified enum values or method signatures may differ — re-run
  `scripts/introspect_api.py` to inspect your installed typelib.

## Run the verification scripts

With SolidWorks open:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\probe_connection.py     # M0
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\m1_block.py             # M1
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\m2_parametric.py        # M2
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\test_mcp_server.py      # M3 (full MCP loop over stdio)
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\m5_demo_bracket.py      # M5 (3D-print bracket, every step verified)
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\m6_demo_kamer.py        # M6 (furnished room assembly, clash-free)
```

`scripts/m6_demo_kamer.py` needs the three sample parts in `D:\Ontwikkeling\Kamer Yara`;
edit `PARTS_DIR` at the top to point at your own parts.

`scripts/introspect_api.py` regenerates/inspects the installed typelib and prints
verified enum values — run it if SolidWorks is upgraded and signatures change.

## Tests

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest                 # all tests
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -m "not solidworks"   # fast unit layer, no SolidWorks
```

Two layers: **pure unit tests** (units, selector/direction parsing, polygon
cleaning, the component-placement maths, and that every MCP tool forwards its
arguments to the right session method) run anywhere; **integration tests**
(`solidworks` marker) drive a running SolidWorks and verify each feature's
volume — or each component's placement — against a hand calc. They auto-skip if
SolidWorks isn't reachable. `pip install -e .[dev]` for pytest.

## Use as an MCP server

The server speaks MCP over **stdio**. Register it with an MCP client (e.g. Claude
Desktop / Claude Code) using the venv's Python:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "solidworks": {
      "command": "D:\\Ontwikkeling\\Solidworks-MCP\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["-m", "solidworks_mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

| `get_assembly_bounding_box` | Bounding box of the whole assembly (min/max/size, mm) |

`export` and `screenshot` work on assemblies too.

Faces are selected by direction in the component's **own** frame (`+x`, `-z`, …),
so a selector keeps meaning the same face however the component is turned. Add
`:inner` (e.g. `+y:inner`) for the cavity side of a hollow part — the inside of a
room wall instead of its outer skin.

All linear dimensions are **millimetres**; the server converts to/from the
SolidWorks-internal metre/radian units at the boundary.

## Architecture

```
src/solidworks_mcp/
  binding.py     early-binding plumbing (wrap raw dispatches in generated classes)
  com_worker.py  one dedicated STA thread; all COM calls serialised through it
  session.py     SolidWorks operations (must run on the COM thread)
  server.py      FastMCP tools that delegate to session via the worker
  constants.py   enum values read from the installed typelib (verified)
  units.py       mm<->m, deg<->rad
  errors.py      SolidWorksError -> agent-facing {ok:false,error}
```

Two non-obvious design decisions, both load-bearing:

1. **Early binding is mandatory.** On this build `GetActiveObject` returns a
   dispatch whose `GetTypeInfo()` fails, so `EnsureDispatch`/`CastTo` cannot infer
   types and pure late binding breaks (`IModelDoc2.FirstFeature` →
   `DISP_E_MEMBERNOTFOUND`). We generate makepy wrappers from the installed
   typelib and wrap each raw dispatch in the right interface class; calls then go
   by dispid via `InvokeTypes`, bypassing name resolution. See `binding.py`.

2. **A dedicated COM thread.** COM is STA and thread-affine. The MCP server runs
   on asyncio, so all COM work is pinned to one worker thread (`com_worker.py`)
   that handlers post to and await — actively enforcing the "one COM session,
   single-threaded" rule that does not hold automatically in an async server.

## Known limitations / roadmap

- Geometry so far: **boxes**, **cylinders/cones** (revolve), **arbitrary
  extruded profiles**, **holes**, **polygon pockets/slots** (`cut_profile`),
  **fillets**, **chamfers**, **shells**, **linear + circular patterns** (bolt
  circles); plus **equations**, **materials**, geometry **inspection**, and
  **save/open** of `.sldprt`, **holes + pockets on any planar face**
  (model→sketch transform), **round flanges** (disc + bore + bolt circle), and
  **slotted holes** (`cut_slot`, obround at any angle — the first arc-based sketch),
  **general revolves** (`add_revolved_profile`: any `(r,z)` profile → shafts,
  vases, rings), **swept pipes/tubes** (`add_swept_pipe`: a round profile along
  a rounded 2D path), and **lofts** (`add_lofted_solid`: blend stacked polygon
  profiles → transitions/adapters), **free-form extrusions**
  (`add_extruded_spline`: a smooth closed spline → organic/aesthetic outlines), and
  **non-circular sweeps** (`add_swept_profile`: any cross-section along a path →
  rails, gaskets, trim). Mirror is shelved — both routes fail
  on this build; an AI mirrors by placing features symmetrically.
- Selection: plane walk, face-by-normal/direction (`_planar_face_by_normal`,
  `+z`/…, with `:inner` for the cavity side of a hollow part), and edge selection
  by axis **or explicit index** (`_select_edges`). `list_faces`/`list_edges` let
  an agent inspect geometry before selecting.
- Assemblies (M6): components, transforms, mates and interference detection.
  Component patterns, in-context features, configurations, drawings and
  Simulation (FEA) are out of scope.
